# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 7, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 1 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I know rules say that I should record pure coding time, instead of tutorials, but I'm giving myself a pass for now. I do plan to keep working on my Job Search Tracker application.

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 2 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Since the first few lessons are mostly refreshers for me, I should move along more quickly.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
