# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: February 7, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 1 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I know the rules say that I should record pure coding time, instead of tutorials, but I'm giving myself a pass for now. I do plan to keep working on my Job Search Tracker application.

### Day 4: February 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 5 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Be careful with inputs and outputs of Python methods
- random.shuffle(iterable): shuffles items in-place, returns None
- random.randint(start, end): integer returned will include both start and end. I wasn't careful with this and experienced IndexError.
